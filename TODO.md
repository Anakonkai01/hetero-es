# TODO — code-level debt

Small, concrete clean-up items. Not a roadmap (see `HETEROES_LLM_MASTER.md`) and not a status report
(see `HETEROES_LLM_STATUS.md`). When an item is done, delete it.

## snapshot-polish  (`src/heteroes/es/snapshot.py`)
- [ ] Docstrings for `take_snapshot`, `diff_from_snapshot`, `restore_from_snapshot_`. State that after a
      `RestoreError` the model state is undefined and the worker must be quarantined.
- [ ] Stop importing the private `_check_param` from `perturb.py`: move the shared checks (and
      `SUPPORT_DTYPE`) to a small shared module.
- [ ] Merge the two `from heteroes.model.schema import ...` lines.
- [ ] Fix inaccurate comments ("copy a tensor from gpu to cpu", "check contiguous"), the typo
      "reinterpretate", the vague "avoid Nan or complement"; resolve or delete both TODOs
      (non-blocking; do we check contiguity of a hand-built `Snapshot`).
- [ ] Type hints (`slab_elements: int` in `diff_from_snapshot`); rename `DEFAULT_SLAB` to
      `DEFAULT_SLAB_ELEMENTS`; drop the unused `entry` in the restore loop; trailing whitespace.
- [ ] `RestoreError` message: "Restore left N tensor(s) different from the snapshot: [...]".

## perturb-polish  (`src/heteroes/es/perturb.py`)
- [ ] Docstring for `perturb_model_` (all-or-nothing, and its limit: a runtime failure such as CUDA OOM
      still leaves the model half perturbed, hence restore).
- [ ] The comment above `sigma_float_32` should say WHY (PyTorch already rounds the scalar to float32;
      the line is kept so we do not depend on that).
- [ ] `resolve_tensors` error message (`schema.py`): include the ACTUAL canonical name of the first
      differing entry.

## schema-polish  (`src/heteroes/model/schema.py`)
- [ ] The two existing `TODO(...)` comments in the source: `schema-validation` (`__post_init__`) and
      `schema-polish` (`canonical_json_bytes`, docstrings, hints).

## notebooks
- [ ] `notebooks/floating_point_testing.ipynb` (untracked): the NumPy cell starts from the float64
      `theta`, the torch cells from `theta_float16`. Use `theta_float16` in both before relying on it.
